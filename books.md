### The Innovators by Walter Isaacson

### A People's History of the United States

### System Error 
by Rob Reich 
> Where Big Tech Went Wrong and How We Can Re..,

I didn't get through this... probably I'm just too in the weeds and didn't find enough interesting. Sorry.

### User Friendly by Cliff Kuang 
> How the Hidden Rules of Design Are Changing the Way We Live, Work, and Play

A weaving of the history of UX and UI, from early innovators and insights. Having lived through this, it seemed strange to call out some specific instances, where I had experienced other ones, but it had many good stories and held together.

### After Steve by Tripp Mickle
> How Apple Became a Trillion-Dollar Company and Lost its Soul
Despite the click-baity title, it was a very positive book mainly about Jonathan Ive and Tim Cook, although many other players are included. It was a nice follow-on to Isaacson's book on Jobs. November 2022

### Steve Jobs, by Walter Isaacson

i’m finish up the walter isaacson book on Steve Jobs (tonight, so I can go). it’s gotten very emotional for me, he was such an amazing person and changed and shaped our world in so many positives ways.mid-read review: from the name “walter isaacson”, I thought he’d write deep academic analysis, but it’s just slightly trashy journalism fare. lots and lots of stories, (many i just barely missed). many great marketing case studies. great stories about people standing up for their values. the pacing of the book may be a little off: he’s been dying for 100 pages, and there’s another 50 pages to go. a typical story from the book (for marketing people who redesign logos): ‘In order to make it more distinctive, he decided he needed a world-class logo. So he courted the dean of corporate logos, Paul Rand. …Rand flew out to Palo alto to spent time with Jobs and listening to his vision… The computer would be a cube, so Rand decided that the logo should be a cube as well, one that was tilted at a a 28° angle. When Jobs asked for a number of options to consider, Rand declared that he did not create different options for clients. “I will solve your problem, and you will pay me,” he told Jobs. “You can use what I produce, or not, but I will not do options, and either way you will pay me.” … the company would pay an astonishing $100,000 flat fee to get one design.’
