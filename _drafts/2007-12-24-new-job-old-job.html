<div class='post'>
At my last job (http://tbd.com), I spent the first five months at a contractor's site, working with their developers. So I had a new job, but I didn't ever see or work with my no co-workers.<br /><br />This, couple with a few other bad coincidences, turned out to be a bad situation. I didn't get a chance to gel with my team (or not gel, and leave) until six months in. Then I saw that it wasn't working, and wasn't going to work, and should have left then. But I had a great co-worker Mike, and really enjoyed just building software. Mike has his idiosyncrasies, but overall he's great. The job had it's challenges, but for a start-up was relatively relaxed (if not slouchy). The enjoyable work out-weighed negative factors.<br /><br />I poked around looking for other opportunities, but the right thing didn't come up (or they wouldn't have me), so I stayed at TBD. But in October Mike left, and it wasn't going to be enjoyable at all. So I needed to move. Talking to my friend Jeff, he suggested the contract company TBD had worked with, Carbon Five. I got along well with them, they were all smart, and they seemed to respect me. I was hesitant, but eventually set up a meeting with Alon there, and pursued it. It turned out they were interested, and when I got into the realities of the job, it got more and more exciting. I quit TBD on Halloween, and started at Carbon Five on December 3.<br /><br />Almost. As part of my exit from TBD, since they had lost both Mike and me, I offered to "contract back" to them for a short period, to facilitate the transition (to what I'm not sure). This seemed like a generous offer to me, and largely motivated to do the right thing. <br /><br />So here I am. Not working for TBD, but working for TBD. I must say it's mostly very good. I've come how several times very jazzed about my work, and never particularly down on it. As I had worked there for four months before, there aren't really surprises. Very enjoyable.<br /><br />TBD is almost less coherent from the outside. <br /><br />Of particular note, on Friday I ended up on a conference call. They were putting pressure on me to complete a feature, but a different contractor, in Seattle, was actually working on the feature. So we had a conference call with him. He had a "help box" on the page, but it wasn't working right. I had spent way too long (days) getting this to behave and work well per a rather tricky visual design. But I had finally gotten it going, and placed it into a re-usable tag. I asked him if he was using the tag, and he quickly told me the name of it, and said no.  He was working on a new one (even though I had done mine less than 5 weeks before), using a "better technology". Actually, we've spent the last 4 months removing the technology he is suing. Oh well. Wrong for three reasons:<br />1. wrong technology<br />2. wrong strategy-- should he be entrusted with exploring new technologies for the project if he's remote and un-managed?<br />3. wrong priorities-- he's working on the highest priority work for the company-- should he be exploring new technologies?<br /><br />I guess he's just totally unmanaged. Sounds like their normal process. Oh well.<br /><br />At least I'm not "really" working for them.</div>
