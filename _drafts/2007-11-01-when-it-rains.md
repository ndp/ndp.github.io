Struggling with the challenges of this last job...  
  
I was the non-integrated member of an integrated team. I worked remotedly, at the office of the contract firm we'd hired, for the first 5 months. When I started I knew I had the wrong job title, but trusted that it would work itself out as it always has. But it proved hard to fix from afar, and then losing a supporter in the CTO (who resigned). Committed to doing the best job within my role was easy, but not being able to reach beyond that role was hard. More specialization than I'd seen at a 20 person company. More hierarchy than I'd experienced at a company 5x the size. I really expected a start-up to have smart, assertive, decisive, experienced people, filling in the pieces as needed. But I saw little of this in action, and I finally gave up the charge yesterday.  
  
I'm eager to move forward. Next post is as project lead at a contract house. Good people, great approach, and constant challenges, I assume. Strong technical requirements, but not so much the focus of the job.
