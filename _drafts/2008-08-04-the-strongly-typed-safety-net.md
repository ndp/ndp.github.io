Strongly typed languages give a false sense of security.  
  
Java is great. It gives you "strong" interfaces: it's the closest thing to programming by contract since Eiffel. Objects know what class they belong to, and therefore have their behaviors precisely enumerated. After using Java for a while, you get comfortable. You have the feeling that you have this solid base you are building upon. You're a construction worker with with top of the line tools. You're a skateboarder with the best board around.   
  
But what do these really tell you? What is it telling you?  
- name (and whatever that implies)  
- what parameters it accepts and their type  
  
Feel like you know what the behavior is.  
  
But do you?  
- deficiencies of function declaration: const, nil?   
- many other business constraints  
- actual behavior
