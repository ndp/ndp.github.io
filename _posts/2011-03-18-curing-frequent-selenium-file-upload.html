The symptom was quite simple: do an upload, and on the next request the server reports an "IOError". As our Ruby on Rails app is pretty much thin workflow around lots of file uploads,  this was a problem. We tended not to see in on production, but us frequent users were seeing it enough to know we had to do something about it.<br /><br />But the real complainer was Selenium. About half the time the tests failed and needed to be coaxed into running again.<br /><br /><a href="http://github.com/jwinky">JWinky</a> traced the root cause down to a known bug in the temp file class. With a little work (and encouragement by yours truly), he put together a patch that has eliminated the problem. We've been running with it for a couple months and haven't seen the bug once-- or heard a peep from Selenium.<br /><br />It's found here: <a href="http://github.com/jwinky/ruby_tempfile_ioerror">http://github.com/jwinky/ruby_tempfile_ioerror</a></div>
