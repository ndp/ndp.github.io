@smrt Thanks. Yeah, none of these are procedural programming languages-- that&#39;s true,-- but you can certainly do complex tasks with them. So I&#39;ll give a small defense:<br /><br />For example, by XML, I really mean the whole family of tools that comes with it, like XSLT. If I write a program in Java to transform an XML document into a web page, that counts, right? If I write the same program in XSLT, is it somehow not programming (even if it is more concise)?</div>

IMO CSS, XML and SQL are not the programming languages.</div>

Very cool.  I can think of ways to enhance it further but that would probably only make it more difficult for the intended audience to grasp in an instant the nature of your experience.  Great job.</div>
