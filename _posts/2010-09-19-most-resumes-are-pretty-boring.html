Every once in a while you find a programmer who "gets creative", rendering their whole resume in C++ syntax or a mindmap. (We are hiring and got one of the creative ones yesterday-- well, I'm not sure <i>what</i> it was, but it managed to communicate I'd never want that person working on a user interface.<span style="background-color: white;">)</span><br /><br />I started to wonder what visualizations would be useful to a reader of a resume. <br /><a name='more'></a>Although I think <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/ndpsoftware">linkedin</a> does a darn fine job, here was one idea I sketched out with my new library <a href="http://github.com/ndp/csster">Csster</a>. &nbsp;I took some inspiration with recent work I've been doing with IDEO, as well as a summer of being surrounded by modern art in the Baltics.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H3rbqY4T-yA/T_EDGfGhgcI/AAAAAAAABF4/1Lz2AVcxSs0/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-07-01+at+7.06.56+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="106" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H3rbqY4T-yA/T_EDGfGhgcI/AAAAAAAABF4/1Lz2AVcxSs0/s400/Screen+Shot+2012-07-01+at+7.06.56+PM.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Primary Programming Languages (click to view)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><span style="background-color: white;">What do you think?
