Most resumes are pretty boring: text descriptions of each job, reverse chronological. Every once in a while you find a programmer who "gets creative", rendering their whole resume in C++ syntax or a mindmap. (We are hiring and got one of the creative ones yesterday-- well, I'm not sure _what_ it was, but it managed to communicate I'd never want that person working on a user interface.)  
  
I started to wonder what visualizations would be useful to a reader of a resume.   
Although I think [linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ndpsoftware) does a darn fine job, here was one idea I sketched out with my new library [Csster](http://github.com/ndp/csster). &nbsp;I took some inspiration with recent work I've been doing with IDEO, as well as a summer of being surrounded by modern art in the Baltics.

What do you think? Is it interesting enough to explore the data?  
  
If you had one visualization to complement your resume, what would you want to convey?<h2>Comments</h2>

@smrt Thanks. Yeah, none of these are procedural programming languages-- that's true,-- but you can certainly do complex tasks with them. So I'll give a small defense:  
  
For example, by XML, I really mean the whole family of tools that comes with it, like XSLT. If I write a program in Java to transform an XML document into a web page, that counts, right? If I write the same program in XSLT, is it somehow not programming (even if it is more concise)?

IMO CSS, XML and SQL are not the programming languages.

Very cool. I can think of ways to enhance it further but that would probably only make it more difficult for the intended audience to grasp in an instant the nature of your experience. Great job.
