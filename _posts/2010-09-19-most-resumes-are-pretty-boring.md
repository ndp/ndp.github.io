Most technical resumes are pretty boring: text descriptions of each job, reverse chronological. Every once in a while you find a programmer who "gets creative", rendering their whole resume in C++ syntax or a mindmap.

I started to wonder what visualizations would be useful to a reader of a resume.   
Although I think [linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ndpsoftware) does a darn fine job, here was one idea I sketched out with my new library [Csster](https://github.com/ndp/csster).  I took some inspiration with recent work I've been doing with IDEO, as well as a summer of being surrounded by modern art in the Baltics.

What do you think? Is it interesting enough to explore the data?  

If you had one visualization to complement your resume, what would you want to convey?
