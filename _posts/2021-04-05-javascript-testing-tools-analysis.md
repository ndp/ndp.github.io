I ran across a nice medium post on the state of Javascript testing. I remember collecting the data for a similar article a couple years ago, but I never edited it down into anything as usable [as Vitali Zaidman did](https://medium.com/welldone-software/an-overview-of-javascript-testing-7ce7298b9870). This is good stuff.

I had started out with a feature chart, and as I'm learning D3, I decided to throw it together [in this Observable notebook.](https://next.observablehq.com/@ndp/javascript-testing-resources)
