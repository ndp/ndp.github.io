<br />I recently published <a href="http://amp-what.com/">amp-what.com</a>. I created it to solve a problem I have: &nbsp;trying to remember (or google) character entity numbers or names. For example, our last project used the entity » (»). Try googling this if you don't remember the name! Now, with this tool, I can just type "&gt;&gt;" and the character, symbol and number appear.<br /><br />It turned out to be surprisingly fun to play with. I discovered <a href="http://amp-what.com/#q=chess">chess pieces</a>, <a href="http://amp-what.com/#q=planet">planet symbols</a>, all sorts of boxes. There are a surprising number of icons to play with. What have you found that surprise you?<br /><br /><a name='more'></a>I initially sourced the tool with the standard 100 or so entities from W3C. Then I supplemented this with 10,000 interesting Unicode characters, and a nice set of entity synonyms from Remy Sharp (whose site is solving the same problem). Seeing that people were sometimes getting no results, I pulled in an internet jargon file for non-conventional names, and supplemented myself, by manually coding them. I am interested in adding more, but want to keep it "offline friendly", which means not too large.<br /><br /><b>I was intrigued by a couple questions around "mobile":&nbsp;</b>I tried to make it "mobile friendly", and the initial version was "small"; small enough to fit on an iPhone screen. This ended up looking sad on larger screens, so that clearly is not the answer. I recently refreshed it with a <i>responsive design</i> approach. Now it uses the screen space nicely on both small and large screens.<br /><br />I also wanted to build an HTML5 <i>offline app</i>. For those of you with an iDevice, you can save to the home screen and have the reference available whether you are online or not.<br /><br />But beyond being mobile "friendly," I believe that HTML5 offers a good alternative to building a native app. I wanted to push the UX and see if I could get it to feel <i>as responsive as a native app</i>-- I think it does a pretty good job at executing quick searches, but I'll leave it up to you to judge.<br /><br /><b>Since the initial prototype, I've layered in a few features:</b>&nbsp;It wanted to be able to link to certain queries, so I used the hashtag to do that, so you can share your favorite queries.<br /><br />I allow changing the font (using the small (f) in the bottom right corner).<br /><br />I found myself wanting to use the Unicode characters in different contexts: not only web pages, but Javascript source and CSS files. I've added some ability to customize the display-- hex, decimal, Javascript, or URL encoded. Those controls are also at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br /><span style="background-color: #fff9ee; color: #222222; font-family: Georgia, Utopia, 'Palatino Linotype', Palatino, serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"><a href="http://amp-what.com/">Check it out</a>, bookmark it, and please send me feedback.</span><br /><br />
