All the visual clutter of the city gets to me. There are wires and (often confusing) signs everywhere. I imagine sometime if all this noise could just be silenced. I took an hour and some crude Photoshop skills to envision parts of my neighborhood [Noe Valley, San Francisco without all the wires.](http://ndpsoftware.com/virtual-underground.php)   
  
These are presented using a NYTimes technique for before/after photos. Go to the page, and then drag the black dividing line to compare the photos.

[As part of a 100-year plan, PG&E is undergrounding some of these wires](http://www.noevalleyvoice.com/1998/June/wires.html), but Muni wires will be with us for a long time.
