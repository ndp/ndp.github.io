<div class="postentry">                                        I threw together a demo of Scriptaculous effects:  <a href="http://ndpsoftware.com/ScriptaculousEffectsDemo.php">http://ndpsoftware.com/ScriptaculousEffectsDemo.php</a>   Nothing crazy here, but I'd like a flexible and interactive demo. Send me ideas or suggestions, Andy                    </div></div>
