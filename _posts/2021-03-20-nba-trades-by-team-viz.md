> “The Warriors look good this year-- they're just all playing for the Lakers.”

As the March 25th trade deadline approaches, I was curious if there's a good way to see how players were "traded" around the NBA. That championship Warriors team, where did the end up? I imagined perhaps one of those cool world maps with comets representing players shooting between US cities in an accelerated timeline.

As I thought about it more, I realized how unhelpful that would be. And I also wanted to get something up and going. This first visualization is a team-oriented chord diagram. Even this coarse data is somewhat interesting, and if you're a fan, it achieves its purpose of encouraging you to dive in. The whole notebook is on [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@ndp/nba-trades-by-team), but you should be able to play around with it here:
