Is using temporary variables was messy? I now advocate writing 1st grade code. By that I mean "See Dick run. See Jane smile." etc. Hey, we're all adults here, you say, why can't I write real code.<br /><br />Well, writing really simple code makes debugging easier. What do I mean? I've had a couple occasions in the last week  where debugging would have been easier if I'd writing really simple code. For example, I just got an null pointer exception here:<br /><br /><pre><br />          _dataSetsNeedingCleanup.add(new DataSetRef(state, dataSet.getId()));<br /></pre><br /><br />I can't easily tell where the problem is coming from. It could be one or two places: my member variable _dataSetsNeedingCleanup could be null, or dataSet itself code be null. If I had written it like this,<br /><br /><pre><br />          final DataSetRef dataSetRef = new DataSetRef(state, dataSet.getId());<br />         _dataSetsNeedingCleanup.add(dataSetRef);<br /></pre><br />a stack trace provided by the user tells me exactly what's wrong. This saves me a whole step in the debugging cycle!</div>
