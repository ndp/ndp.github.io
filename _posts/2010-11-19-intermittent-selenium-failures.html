Selenium testing is always a little flakey, but I've* found a good treatment for this on my last two projects. It's pretty simple, really:<br /><br /><i>If you are using external Javascript services, turn them off.</i><br /><br />This includes Google Analytics, Kiss Metrics, Share This, etc. The number of these services has exploded in the last couple years, and it's hard to build a site that doesn't use at least a couple. These tools do what they can to not interfere, but in the fast-paced world of Selenium, they don't always survive. Just remove them for these tests and you'll see marked improvement.<br /><br />Actually, that reminds me of a good talk I heard the other night. It was by Marcus Westin and Martin Hunt &nbsp;of Meebo, and they talked about developing he "Meebo Bar". They figured out some really cool tricks to load asynchronously and not interfere with the host website-- but even better, supporting security contexts client side (which is pretty nifty if you think about it.) I actually think you could build a pretty clever SSO (single sign on) solution using these patterns, but I haven't tackled that one yet. Check the <a href="http://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/event/44/Building%20Fast%20Webapps,%20Fast%20_Lessons%20From%20Creating%20the%20Meebo%20Bar_%20Presentation.ppt">slides</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7SUFLFu3HI">presentation</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A must read if you're developing your own widget.<br /><br />* Actually, credit where credit's due: it was Justin and Jonah (different companies, different projects, not brothers) who identified this problem, not me.
