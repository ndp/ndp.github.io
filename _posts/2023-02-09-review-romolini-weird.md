I just finished [listening to](https://amzn.to/3xc4M3G) [Weird in a World That's Not](https://amzn.to/3Yo3AWS) by Jennifer Romolini. <img src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VQQtdtVsL.jpg' style='width: 30%; float: right' />  She takes you from her being a misfit in high school to college experiences, all the way through a meandering path to high-tech start-up/Brooklyn/kids/mom/psychics nivana. 

It's a quick read (listen), and there is plenty of entertaining stories and advice (mostly for younger folks), but my main takeaway is: this is an refreshing book, sprinkled with feminism, neurodiversity, classism, poverty usually sanitized from business manuscripts. 

I've read lotsa business books, and memoirs often have a "be yourself" theme. But in Romolini's, it's more refreshingly and candidly presented than I've read before. It convinced me there's hope. Why can't more business books be like this?
