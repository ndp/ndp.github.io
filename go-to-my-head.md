title: About "Go to My Head"
---

[Go To My Head](gotomyhead.site) is a web application to find charts in the various "fake" books:
The Real Book, The New Real Book, etc. They are similar to web pages:
- [Ron Hacket Music provides an index to the  6 Real Book volumes from Hal Leonard](https://ronhackettmusic.com/data/searchRB.php) and 
- [Seventh String has an exhaustive listing](https://www.seventhstring.com/fbindex.html)

These are great, but impractical to use in the midst of a gig. And who hasn't
heard, "Which book is that in?" while counting off the next song. So, **Go To My Head** 
tool attempts to provide a tool specifically tailored to that use case.

This includes:

- working well on modern mobile devices, with varied screen sizes
- simple so it will work well in the midst of a gig 
- work well with low-fi or no internet connectivity
- a little bit of visual appeal

On most devices, you should be able to bookmark the site, and it will work
without the internet present.

## Feedback

I started with an index from the "realbook splitter". If you want some other 
books, feel free to send me the index or point me to it.

So far, I have invested just a few hours, and am interested in feedback 
if this is useful to anyone else.

Just write to me at [andy@ndpsoftware.com](mailto:andy@ndpsoftware.com?subject=Go+to+my+head).
